Description: This package offers a comprehensive framework for analyzing a simple
 heterogeneous step stress accelerated life testing (hSSALT) model, assuming the
 cumulative exposure (CE) model and heterogeneity with two subgroups under the
 second stress level for both continuous and interval monitoring. The supported
 life time distribution is the exponential distribution. The hSSALT model considers 
 exponential lifetime distributions. For continuous monitoring, the package supports 
 both Type-I and Type-II censoring, while for interval monitoring, it supports only 
 Type-I censoring with equally spaced inspections. Additionally, the package can 
 examine whether a dataset from an SSALT experiment justifies the implementation 
 of an hSSALT model by a homogeneity test. However, only continuous monitoring 
 under the exponential distribution is supported. The package includes four core 
 functions and one example dataset.
