Description: This package offers a comprehensive framework for analyzing a simple heterogeneous 
    step stress accelerated life testing (hSSALT) model, assuming the cumulative exposure (CE) model 
    and heterogeneity with two subgroups under the second stress level for both continuous and interval 
    monitoring. The supported life time distribution is the exponential distribution. The hSSALT model 
    considers exponential lifetime distributions. For continuous monitoring, the package supports both 
    Type-I and Type-II censoring, while for interval monitoring, it supports only Type-I censoring with 
    equally spaced inspections. Additionally, the package can examine whether a dataset from an SSALT 
    experiment justifies the implementation of an hSSALT model by a homogeneity test. However, only 
    continuous monitoring under the exponential distribution is supported. The package includes four
    core functions and one example dataset.
